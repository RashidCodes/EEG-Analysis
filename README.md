# Depth of Anaesthesia assessment using Electroencephalography 

This repository contains my work which involves the use of Shallow machine learning models to predict the depth of anaesthesia of patients undergoing surgery. The project involves several phases including 

- Data collection
- Data preprocessing 
- Feature Extraction
- Feature Selection 
- Model Building 
- Model Evaluation 

Check each branch to see how I incrementally modelled the EEG data using a **Support Vector Machine**.
