ADVICE
------
1. Present one final model in your dissertation
2. Don't present all the models you found
3. In your appendix, you can mention you've tried other featuresets
4. Only use one paragraph to mention you've tried different methods in the body.

5. In the body, present only the best featureset. present how you got the features present how you selected them. Present the scatterplots.



ADD A NEW THING
---------------
1. Look at section 7.4.2. Talks about Signal Quality

2. You have to show that your model is better than the BIS.

3. Use the patients that have SQI. You only need to present them in section 7.4.2.

4. Use Class D first. Don't worry too much about Class C. Make sure you cut down the SQI to make the lengths the same.

5. Choose just 2 patients.
